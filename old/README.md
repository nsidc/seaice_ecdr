This directory contains "old" but possibly still useful code. Probably should be
deleted.

The `compare` dir contains code for doing visualizations/comparisons of AMSR2 vs SII data. This was useful during our our first phase of work on tihs project but we have not kept up with updating this code and it's now quite a bit out of date.
